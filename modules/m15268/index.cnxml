		<para id="element-861">An example answer: I imagine a locus as slots for alleles. In diploid organisms, each individual will have two 'slots' or two loci for the particular gene of interest, one per chromosome. If only two alleles exist to fill every slot in this population, the slots that are not filled with one of those two alleles must be filled with the second. Consequently, if 50% of the slots are filled with <emphasis>A</emphasis> alleles, then the remaining 50% must be filled with <emphasis>a</emphasis> alleles to account for 100% of the population's loci. Because 50% is equivalent to a frequency of 0.5, then the frequency of the <emphasis>A</emphasis> allele or p equals 0.5 as does the frequency of the <emphasis>a</emphasis> allele or q so that p + q = 1. </para>

		<para id="element-158">Letâ€™s consider a real example of this. In 2005, Stefasson <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> reported the fascinating discovery of an allele in humans whose presence is associated with increased fertility in Icelandic and European populations. Females with at least one copy of the allele have approximately 3.5%, and males 2.9%, more children on average than non-carriers. The exact mechanism by which the allele, known as H2, affects fertility is unknown. 
		</para><para id="element-45">If we know that 21% of European loci for this gene house the H2 allele, then how frequently must the single alternative allele, H1, for that locus occur in this population? Why?   </para>

		<para id="element-642">If 21% of the loci (equivalent to a frequency of 0.21) in a population contain the H2 allele and H1 is the only other possible allele for this locus, then 79% of the remaining loci (equivalent to a frequency of 0.79) must have this allele. No other alleles exist for this locus consequently, if H2 does not occur at a locus then H1 must be there instead.

		<para id="element-283">Your colleague was probably surprised because she thought that B1 and B2 were the only two alleles that occurred at this locus in this population.

Your suggestion to look for at least one additional allele to account for the 10% of the alleles unaccounted for in her study is well taken. She realizes that the existence of one or more additional alleles would explain the missing 10% and enable her to bring the summed allele frequencies for the B locus to 1.

<para id="element-416">The formulae generated above - p2, 2pq and q2 - constitute the fundamental components of the Hardy-Weinberg equation. Thus, they describe the genotype frequencies you will see in a population, with respect to a single locus with only two alleles, if the population is not subject to any agent of evolution. That is, all individuals in the population are equally likely to survive and to produce offspring that survive.  </para><para id="element-704">Because together these formulae account for 100% of the genotypes this population could produce, they can be summarized and are often written in the following way:  </para><list id="element-492" list-type="bulleted"><item>p2 (<emphasis>AA</emphasis>) + 2pq (<emphasis>Aa</emphasis>) + q2 (<emphasis>aa</emphasis>) = 1  </item>

<item><emphasis>frequency</emphasis> - the number of times an event or observation, for example a particular measurement or condition like blue eyes, is observed in a collection of events or observations like those comprising a sample, population or study. In this statistical sense, a frequency is equivalent to a proportion. For example, the frequency of a particular allele is equal to the number of times that allele is observed in a population over the total number of alleles for that locus in the population.
